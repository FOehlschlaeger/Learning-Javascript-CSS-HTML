# JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1

## Hello World!

#### Accessing the browser console
In the browser (such as Google Chrome) open a console via `"right click" + Inspect`. In this `Console`, testing code can be exectued. 
```javascript
> alert("Hello World!")
```
This command opens a new pop-up window in the browser. This JavaScript code will immediately get evaluated by hitting `Enter`.

Some more (commented) JavaScript code:
```
> let js = 'amazing' // This is a variable definition.
> if (js === 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is Fun!') // if condition to print a string.
> if (js === "amazing") alert("JavaScript is Fun!") // single or double quotes does not seem to make any difference.

> js = "boring"
> if (js === 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is Fun!') // nothing will happen since variable "js" is "boring".

> (js === "amazing") // returns `false`
```

Math operations in console:
```javascript
> 40+8+23-10 // 61
```

## What is JavaScript? 
> JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
- `high-level`: do not worry about memory management
- `object-oriented`: based on object concepts, for storing most kinds of data
- `multi-paradigm`: use different styles of programming
- `programming language`: instruct computer to do things

### Role of JavaScript in Web Development
The three core technologies to create interactive and dynamic websites and web applications:
- HTML5: Content (text, images, buttons) = `Noun` such as `<p> </p>` means `paragraph`
- CSS: Style and presentation (laying out the elements) = `Adjectives` such as `p {color : red}` means the paragraph text is red
- JavaScript: Programming language for building web applications (load content from remote servers, building entire applications in the browser called web applications) = `Verbs` such as `p.hide()` means hiding the paragraph

### Example
- Website with loading spinners: JavaScript is loading data in background from website server
- As soon as the data is loaded, JavaScript hides that spinners and shows the loaded content instead
- JavaScript also shows pop-up windows and hides them by clicking outside of the pop-up box ("tweet box" on twitter)
- JavaScript shows hovering information by hovering over an specific area loading the data on-the-fly

### JavaScript
- dynamic effects and web applications in the browser
- Frameworks based on JavaScript such as `React`, `Angular`, `Vue` make writing large applications easier and faster
- can also run outside of web browsers on web servers
- **Backend Applications**: using JavaScript for web applications on web servers: `node.js` (does need any browser)
- **Frontend Applications**: applications run in browsers based on JavaScript
- Native Mobile Applications and Desktop Applications: for any Phone and Computer Operating Systems with frameworks such as `ionic`, `electron`

### JavaScript Releases
- Big update in 2015: `ES6 / ES2015`
- ES = ECMA Script
- new releases with a couple of new features on yearly basis
- Modern JavaScript: all yearly releases after `ES6`
- **This course covers modern JavaScript, but without forgetting the older parts**

## JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1
- Usually, JavaScript is attached to webpages, at least for frontend applications
- JavaScript needs to be attached to an HTML document, this is why a file such as `index.html` is necessary
- In HTML there is `<script>` tag, where JavaScript code can be written
```html
<html>
<head>
    ...
    <style>
        ...
    </style>
    <!-- 
        This inline script-section is for JavaScript code. 
        But usually, this JavaScript code is stored in a separate file `script.js` to separate JavaScript from HTML code. 
    -->
    <script>
        let js = "amazing";
        if (js === "amazing") alert("JavaScipt is FUN!");

        40 + 8 + 23 - 10;
        console.log(40 + 8 + 23 - 10);
    </script>
</head>

<body>
    ...
</body>
</html>
...
```
- To "execute" this code open the file `index.html` in the browser
- Reloading the page in the browser causes the file to be executed again
- `console.log()` prints output to the browsers console (via `inspect`)


### Linking JavaScript file to HTML file
- Usually, to separate JavaScript code from HTML distinct files are created, also for better maintaining and funtionality separation: `script.js`
```javascript
let js = "amazing";
if (js === "amazing") alert("JavaScipt is FUN!");

40 + 8 + 23 - 10;
console.log(40 + 8 + 23 - 10);
```
- This `script.js` to the HTML file `index.html`, add a script section to the HTML body
```html
<html>
<head>
    ...
</head>

<body>
    <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals â€“ Part 1</h1>

    <script src="./script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```
