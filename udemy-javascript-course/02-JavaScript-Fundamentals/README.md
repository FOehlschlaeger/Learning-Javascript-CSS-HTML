# JavaScript Fundamentals - Part 1

### Hello World!

#### Accessing the browser console
In the browser (such as Google Chrome) open a console via `"right click" + Inspect`. In this `Console`, testing code can be exectued. 
```javascript
> alert("Hello World!")
```
This command opens a new pop-up window in the browser. This JavaScript code will immediately get evaluated by hitting `Enter`.

Some more (commented) JavaScript code:
```
let js = 'amazing' // This is a variable definition.
if (js === 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is Fun!') // if condition to print a string.
if (js === "amazing") alert("JavaScript is Fun!") // single or double quotes does not seem to make any difference.

js = "boring"
if (js === 'amazing') alert('JavaScript is Fun!') // nothing will happen since variable "js" is "boring".

(js === "amazing") // returns `false`
```

Math operations in console:
```javascript
40+8+23-10 // 61
```
